        Image Acquisition Guidelines:
        - Use a high-resolution camera for better accuracy.
        - Ensure even lighting to avoid shadows and reflections.
        - Capture images from multiple angles, covering all sides of the limb.
        - Maintain consistent distance from the limb in all images.
        - Use a neutral background to enhance segmentation.
        - Include a reference object or scale marker in some images.
