- 3D printing
- Digital processing
- Analysis in medical applications, particularly in prosthetics and orthotics

The 3D representations aim to revolutionize the medical device fitting process and enhance the quality of custom medical devices, including prosthetic sockets and orthotic frames[^1].

### Primary Purpose

The main purpose of Forma is to provide an advanced tool for creating *custom medical devices* for individuals with anatomical variations. This technology seamlessly combines traditional fabrication methods with state-of-the-art digital solutions, offering a more precise and efficient approach to medical device manufacturing.

### Key Functionality

A core feature of Forma is its ability to generate accurate 3D models of anatomical structures. By using multiple image inputs, the system helps develop personalized medical solutions that integrate harmoniously with the patient's anatomy. This approach significantly reduces the need for manual measurements and adjustments, leading to improved fit and comfort for patients.

Forma processes multiple images of the target anatomical structure and its contralateral counterpart (if applicable) to create a comprehensive 3D model. This model serves as the foundation for creating custom medical devices that match the characteristics of the patient's anatomy with unprecedented accuracy. The system's ability to capture fine details and subtle contours ensures that the resulting medical devices provide optimal support and functionality.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Image Acquisition

*Guidelines for optimal image capture*:

- Use uniform, diffused lighting to minimize shadows and ensure even illumination.
- Capture multiple angles with 70-80% overlap between adjacent shots for robust reconstruction.
- Maintain consistent camera-to-subject distance to ensure uniform image scale.
- Use a neutral, non-reflective background to isolate the subject.
- Include standardized reference markers for scaling and color calibration.
- Ensure subject maintains a stable position throughout the image capture process.
- Use a high-resolution camera (20MP minimum) in manual mode for consistent exposure.
- Set a small aperture (high f-number) to maximize depth of field.
- Use a low ISO setting to minimize noise in the images.
- Consider using a turntable for small objects to ensure consistent angular separation between shots.

### 2. Image Preprocessing

Forma's preprocessing module enhances raw images for superior 3D reconstruction:

1. **Noise Reduction**: Applies advanced algorithms such as Non-Local Means denoising to reduce image noise while preserving fine details.
2. **Contrast Enhancement**: Improves image contrast using adaptive histogram equalization for better feature detection.
3. **Background Removal**: Isolates the anatomical structure from the background using semantic segmentation techniques.
4. **Image Alignment**: Ensures consistent orientation across all images using feature matching and homography estimation.
5. **Color Correction**: Applies color calibration based on reference markers to ensure consistent coloration across all images.
6. **Lens Distortion Correction**: Removes lens distortion effects for more accurate 3D reconstruction.
7. **Image Resizing**: Optionally resizes images to balance processing speed and detail preservation.
8. **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts and organizes EXIF data for use in the reconstruction process.

### 3. Camera Calibration

Forma uses a robust camera calibration process to ensure accurate measurements:

1. **Calibration Pattern**: Use the provided checkerboard pattern for calibration shots.
2. **Multiple Angles**: Capture the calibration pattern from various angles and distances.
3. **Automatic Detection**: Forma automatically detects the calibration pattern in images.
4. **Parameter Estimation**: Calculates intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters.
5. **Distortion Correction**: Estimates and corrects for lens distortion.

### 4. 3D Reconstruction

The 3D reconstruction process in Forma involves several sophisticated steps:

1. **Feature Detection**: Identifies distinct features in each image using algorithms like SIFT or ORB.
2. **Feature Matching**: Matches features across multiple images to establish correspondences.
3. **Structure from Motion (SfM)**: Estimates camera positions and creates a sparse 3D point cloud.
